# biggie-splays
A bigger split keyboard with stagger and splay, for those who want too many keys.

Currently I have completed designs for Choc v1 and v2. I have not tested it but I intend to order PCBs of the v2 design soon. I don't know if I will revisit this one for other switch types. Probably would be a cool MX board though...

I will eventually be working up a case for this one, unlike my previous designs which have all been caseless. Stay tuned!

Please note I have hacked up a couple of the ergogen footprints. In particular the XIAO one has the underside pads that I'm not using removed and replaced with silkscreen drawings. Because that's just a layer change they're easy to put back, either by editing the footprint or manually in KiCad. There's also a reverse-polarity version of the JST connector in the footprints dir, but I ended up not using it.

I am still really new at all of this! Feedback and suggestions are highly encouraged!
